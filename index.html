    <h2>India gate</h2>
    <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a
        crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their
        lives
        fighting for the British Army during the World War I.</p>
